For anyone who's reading this, well, enjoy reading my self-comments & progress.
I figured it would be a great way to improve my English and, well, kill time, maybe
keep tracks of my work too, so I can put up a change log on my future website...
I needed a text file which can be edited as quickly as possible, so I decided I would
add it to the resources.I may add a way to read this file in the program soon.

This includes:
	A to-do list (which I probably will never complete)
	A complete change log with the builds
	
From build 20, I decided to exclude this file from the program's executable

I. TODO:
	*  Add file splitting function
		PROGRESS: Still need to fix bugs & improve
	*  Add file merging function
		PROGRESS: Still need to fix bugs & improve
	=> Fix bugs (will never be done...)
	=> Finish the encrypt function
		PROGRESS: Pretty close, I'll need just a few hours to finish this.
		I'm just too lazy to lay my hands on it ^^
	-  Rewrite from scratch the Split & Merge codes
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, checked and it's possible, but may take a
		day to finish.
	-  Add File checksum function
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, it's possible.
	-  Add File mass renamer function
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, but still figuring out several stuffs.
	-  Add File searching function
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, not sure about the performance, though.
	-  Add File packing function
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, it's possible, and will be fun to implement
	-  Add encrypting for splitting & merging
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, but only possible after I rewrite the splitting &
		merging code
	-  Add duplicate file finding function
		PROGRESS: Had the idea, not sure if it's possible and about the performance.
	-  Add icons
		PROGRESS: Will be done when I want to kill time
	#  Add associations & commands
		PROGRESS: Finished for Merging function. Not sure for the splitting function, though
	#  (Most unlikely: Add the ability to change skins)
		PROGRESS: Got the idea and the basics, even trying the button, it will be very
		time-consuming and not-needed though.
	#  (Most unlikely: Code everything from scratch in VB6)
		PROGRESS: If this thing's wanna be portable, then VB6 suits it the most. Fortunately,
		with Windows 7 and Vista, hopefully I won't need to do this.
	#  Make this thing open-sourced
		PROGRESS: Only after I give up this project and like throw it away. The embarrassment
		with how unprofessional & messed up the code is is just too much to bear...
	#  Clean the code
		PROGRESS: This will make things a little easier for me to debug & open-source this.
		Unfortunately, I don't have time to do it.
	#  Improve the split/merge progress with multi threading
		PROGRESS: I thought of the idea, but not sure if it'll boost the performance. I must
		take some experiments, if the speed differences is so noteable, I may do it to compete
		with other file splitting/merging programs.
	
	Legends:
		*  : Done
		=> : In progress
		-  : Will be done
		#  : Optional
	Estimated time to finish: Probably 2011...

	Bugs Fixed:
		Fixed a critical bug in the splitting function
		Fixed some memory leaks
		Added some error handlers
		 _________________________________________________________________________
		| COMMENTS: The initial release of File Splitter. I really hope it can get|
		|           farther from here                                             |
		o-------------------------------------------------------------------------o

		Fixed a progress bar bug
		Fixed a timer bug
		Improved the error handlers
		 _________________________________________________________________________
		| COMMENTS: This is another important release as the file merging function|
		|           is added.                                                     |
		o-------------------------------------------------------------------------o
		
		   Version 1.00 Beta Build 3
	New Features:

	Bugs Fixed:
		Fixed some interface bugs
		
			Version 1.00 Beta Build 4
	Bugs Fixed: A lot of minor bugs
		
17/6/2009: Version 1.00 Beta Build 5
	New Features:
		The ability to change languages
		 _________________________________________________________________________
		|           Language-changing ability is not a priority and not a very    |
		|           important function. I just added it for the sake of           |
		| COMMENTS: completeness. Besides, I always want to make English programs,|
		|           but people in Vietnam of course want the progs to have        |
		|           Vietnamese interface. So I feel adding this ability would     |
		|           satisfy everyone including myself ^^                          |
		o-------------------------------------------------------------------------o

	Bugs Fixed:

		Used multi-threading for the splitting process		
		 ________________________________________________________________________
		|           Adding multi-threading made a major performance boost for my |
		|           program. Plus, with this, the program should work better with|
		|           less bugs, the 'Stop' button should work better. Plus, with  |
		| COMMENTS: this, there's no need for caching if you have a lot of memory|
		|           as the program can still run flawlessly, no need to add codes|
		|           to response to Windows messages so it's not 'Not Responding' |
		|           or as I and most people usually say, 'hang'                  |
		o------------------------------------------------------------------------o

		 _________________________________________________________________________
		|           I was bored with the project since the end of last month, so I|
		|           decided to give up with it. But my friend helped me notice    |
		|           that Mediafire've just put a server in Vietnam, so the        |
		|           is so much faster. I took the chance to download some stuff,  |
		| COMMENTS: and I need a file-joining program afterwards to merge my files|
		|           I used this program, and as it was inconvenience, I decided to|
		|           revive the project and working with the bugs (Well, I can't   |
		|           find bugs if I don't use the program, and I'll be using it for|
		|           whole upcoming days, I'll fix all the bugs I can find, adding |
		|           new functions, to make it more convenience for me ^^          |

		 ______________________________________________________________________
		|       the function is very basic, with no error handler, and I plan  |
		| NOTE: no further support for it, since it's not so important in my   |
		|       opinion. I just added it because I was bored. Really, it's a   |
		|       nice time killer.                                              |

		Removed some unused variables & functions (mainly, these are used for testing)
		 ______________________________________________________________________
		|       In this build, I'm also getting closer to finishing the encrypt|
		| NOTE: function. I coded a few key and IV generating functions, and   |
		|       made a base class for the encryption/decryption progress. Hope |
		|       the function will be done in the next few days...              |
		o----------------------------------------------------------------------o
		
5/8/2009: Version 1.00 Beta Build 19
	Bugs Fixed:
